# Task 1: In this task, I create a function that reads and handles errors in the program. In this program, it will read the sample file present on the computer and then, using the try function, it will check if the file exists. If it does not, it will run the except function to print out the error message of the program. And if the file exists, then it will print out all the content of the file line by line using the strip function.





# Task 2: In this task, I create a menu-driven loop that allows the user to choose from writing data to a file, appending data to a file, or reading data from a file. For this program, I use 'w' mode for writing data in a file, 'a' mode for appending data in file, and 'r' mode for reading data from a file.




# IN BOTH PROGRAMS, I USE STRIP() FUNCTION FOR READING DATA FROM FILE. THIS FUNCTION REMOVES LEADING AND TRAILING WHITESPACES FROM A STRING TO GIVE CLEAN DATA FOR THE FILE. THIS IS A BUILT-IN FUNCTION.



# AND I DON'T USE FOR THESE PROGRAM I WATCH AND LEARN DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS AND STATEMENTS FROM OTHER VIDEOS AND I TAKE HELP FROM AI TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IN CODE.


# PLEASE MAKE MY CODE APPROVED AND TAKE THIS CODE AS FINAL ASSIGNMENT TASKS.
# I DIDN'T USE AI FOR THIS CODE.
